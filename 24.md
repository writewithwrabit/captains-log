# Day 24 - November 6, 2019

I have to admit, I am pretty proud of the work I merged in today. I've spent the last three or four days implementing React's Concurrent Mode and Suspense. There is a [great post on the React blog](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/11/06/building-great-user-experiences-with-concurrent-mode-and-suspense.html) about building great user expriences with these tools. The inspiration to start doing what I finished today all started at React Conf. I was exposed to Concurrent Mode, Suspense, and the "render as you fetch" pattern.

Wrabit has always been about the product but I also wanted it to be a learning experience for me. I've really connected with my desire to build fast, fun, and beautiful UI lately. Wrabit is a bit of an exploration in that. I'm not fully done implementing Suspense (I need to build out my loading states) but the app has pretty nice performance now. I'm excited to continue to tweak the knobs and make it better for the users in the coming months.

Oh, and I'm going to give a talk at [React Vancouver](https://reactvancouver.com/) about this!

- [x] Merged render-as-you-fetch
