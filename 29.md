# Day 29 - November 29, 2019

Well I had a bit of a stretch goal to launch this Sunday. I won't be hitting that goal. I've been catching up on school since I talked at React Vancouver. I guess there is no need to rush things but I do have to launch before 2020. That is my deadline. I'm actually so close and I don't see why I can't get the MVP out before then. No excuses; if I don't it is just because I didn't work hard enough.

Today I worked on adding some proper fallback components (loading states). Now when my React components suspend they show some nice little empty states. Not perfect but good enough for launch! I have to be okay with _good enough_. :)

I may have found someone who is interested in helping going forward so that'll be nice!

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Implemented 3 loading states for components that fetch data
- [x] Reviewed some security wranings on the frontend; didn't need to resolve them as they are just CLI tools not used in prod
- [x] Signed up for [Renovate](https://renovate.whitesourcesoftware.com/) to help keep dependencies up to date
- [x] Worked on some issue creation/editing on both `webapp` and `server` repos

Challenges:

- Smooth sailing again
