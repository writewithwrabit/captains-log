# Day 22 - November 2, 2019

Today I was feeling pretty lazy and distracted. Usually when I feel this way I'll avoid Wrabit in general. I definitely need to get over this so that I can get Wrabit out in the world. Like most humans, I have many weaknesses.

I overcame this challenge by again allowing myself to just do a little work and be satisfied with that. A lot of the tasks I need to get done are quite large but can be completed by breaking them down.

I started working on the stats page. I got a basic design down for the MVP and will work on hooking up data tomorrow. A small contribution but still progress.

As I continue to develop, I keep feeling like my original landing page isn't right. It doesn't _feel_ like Wrabit to me. My partner was telling me it's fine and not to worry about it but if it's not right, I can't just leave it. I will leave it for now, but after the app is done I am going to rework it. I want it to feel more like the app itself. I want the Wrabit brand and identity to carry throughout the app which it doesn't.

This is something I can iterate on over time but was important for me to come to terms with. I spent the evening looking at lots of pleasant designs so I can continue strengthening what I want in my head. This isn't something I did prior to getting the logo/landing page design which is why there is such cognitive dissonance with it now. Oh well, another lesson learned!

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Implemented basic stats page
- [x] Got lots of inspiration for the landing page (yes... I'm going to rebuild it)

Challenges:

- Feeling lazy and distracted
- Not happy with the landing page
