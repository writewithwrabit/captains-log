# Day 17 - October 8, 2019

[Word Mental Health Day](https://www.who.int/mental_health/world-mental-health-day) is coming up. Given the theme related to Wrabit, I'm going to take the opportunity to share Wrabit with the world. The landing page is good enough to share with some folks now.

I knew I wouldn't have time to build a new system for capturing emails so I will take advantage of the [Product Hunt page](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/wrabit) that I already made. I did tweak the upcoming page a little be inspired by the landing page.

Showing the world what I have so far is going to be tough. It's more than I've shared before but the product still doesn't exist. There is plenty of room for failure. The hardest aspect of sharing for me is wishing everything were better. More pleasant to look at, more functonal. I know that shipping is far better than perfection but this is new to me. Perhaps I should start sharing updates publicly?

I hope that people get some benefit out of Wrabit. Working on it with the public eye is beneficial.

My goal is to launch by the end of the year. I see no reason I can't hit that goal for the MVP at least.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Made the landing page responsive (enough for launch)
- [x] Tweaked the [Product Hunt upcoming page](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/wrabit) to use some design resources
- [x] Added links to the [Product Hunt upcoming page](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/wrabit
- [x] Added Open Graph tags to make sharing better

Challenges:

- Letting go of (pixel) perfection
