# Day 10 - September 15, 2019

Day ten. One month after I wrote a line of code for Wrabit. I'm proud to say I finished my first semester of university. I spent the last month studying for a math exam. I don't have my marks yet but I don't think I did too bad. I was the best man at my best friend's wedding and I even gave a speech (which terrified me). It's been a good month with some ups and downs, but I'm back in action.

Last month I started off working on the page where a user can view their previous entries. Today I finished that off. I finished off some basic functionality for the calendar picker and styled it up. I also did a bunch of refactoring which always feels nice. There is a lot to do but I am feeling quite good about it.

After some discussion with my girlfriend, Wrabit will be making a positive impact that I'm extremely excited about. I'm going to keep it under wraps for now but I'm excited for the launch. I'll work on keeping the MVP slim and launching as soon as possible. I'll iterate with user feedback once I have it.

This project means a lot to me and I can't wait to share it with the world.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Converted Apollo Client to start using [Reatc hooks](https://blog.apollographql.com/apollo-client-now-with-react-hooks-676d116eeae2)
- [x] Add highlighting to calendar for a user's entries
- [x] Add the ability to view previous entries
- [x] Discovered a new differentiator for Wrabit
- [x] Filter out entries where the word count is zero from backend query
  - I will want to create a job that deletes these entries from the DB in the future
- [x] Minor refactoring plus cleaning up dead code (yes, dead code already exists... whoops!)

Challenges:

- I took a month off so jumping back into the middle of a feature being developed has some challenges.
