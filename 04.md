# Day 04 - July 22, 2019

I was talking to a friend about Wrabit and he asked if I had thought about launching Wrabit with the lean approach. Basically, create a landing page and generate interest prior to building the product. While I do believe that's a valuable approach, I think there is already market validation for this idea. It's also an exercise for me from a technical and personal perspective. Can I acttually launch something? Can I truly finish things instead of dropping them when something new and exciting comes along? I think I can.

Even with some failed experimentation, I made some important progress today. The API now handles authentication with users (thanks Firebase)! Modern day development makes me even more impressed with people who have been coding for ten or twenty years. I'm so lucky to have all the tools that are available to me. I can't even imagine how difficult it was to make something like Amazon or Google back in the day.

Tomorrow I will try to get implemen Apollo on the webapp and then the fun begins! Once I have connection between the frontend and the backend, I won't have to worry about infrastructure as much. There is a lot of work to do but things are going quite smoothly.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Created a [Product Hunt landing page](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/wrabit) with Ship. Using what my friend said, I'm going to try to generate a little bit of interest _while_ I build Wrabit.
- [x] Signed up for a Stripe account.
- [x] Styled the login page.
- [x] Setup basic signup page.
- [x] Bought writewithwrabit.com.
- [x] Implemented API authorization with Firebase auth.

Challenges:

- Using [GCP's IAP](https://cloud.google.com/iap/) looks like it's going to be perfect for my frontend to talk to the backend but I have to deploy a working version to fully test. It works locally but I have hardcoded the private key, etc. Not sure how it will work in the now environment.
  - It was a fun experiment but this won't work on he frontend. The API needs to be public and integrate with my Firebase auth.
