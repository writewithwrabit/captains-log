# Day 14 - October 1, 2019

Today after work I was feeling a little lazy. Drained. However, I found out about [Sqreen](https://www.sqreen.com/) because [a friend of mine](https://speakbox.ca/) was using it. Knowing how much work I have to do, I can't really afford to be lazy. I decided I would do one small thing today. Install Sqreen.

After installing Sqreen I was motivated to do more work. I had to put a badge in the footer to get a community account for Sqreen. This highlights something that doesn't exist yet. The landing page. I do personally think I should focus more on the app itself but today I wasn't feeling ready to tackle the streaks algorithm. The landing page though? The design is beautiful, I think it would be fun, and if it was done I might be able to start sharing the website.

So while I didn't necessarily _deliver anything_ in regards to the landing page, I started it! That's still a win.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Installed [Sqreen](https://www.sqreen.com/) to protect users from attacks
- [x] Started developing the landing page
- [x] Finished the hero section of the landing page

Challenges:

- Today my biggest challenge was my desire to stay off the computer and do nothing after work... but I defeated that urge!
