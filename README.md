# Wrabit Captain's Log

A [friend of mine](http://www.thefreshburst.com/) gave me the idea that I should keep track of what I'm doing while I build. Perhaps it will help me solve problems more effectively in the future. Perhaps not. Either way, this will serve as my memory during the various phases of development that Wrabit goes through.

Three sheets to the wind!
