# Day 19 - October 15, 2019

One of the biggest issues with me working on Wrabit so far has been consistency. I don't work on it every day. That means it will take me longer to launch. Does this really matter? Probably not. I want to launch so I can start getting user feedback and getting users in general. Perhaps there isn't any real rush but I want to make sure I don't spend too much time perfecting things people want.

Today I was able to fix a bug related to the daily entry. When user's used to login for the first time during the day, it would create a new entry at whatever time they logged in. The problem with that was, if they logged in at an earlier time the next day, they would get the same entry. Now entries are based on midnight in the user's timezone. This should ensure they will get a new entry if it is in fact a new day.

I also finished the initial work on something I have been avoiding. Streaks. Streak math seems like it should be straightforward. However, it is very important for Wrabit. The donations depend on solid streak calculations. If I ever hope to automate this in any fashion I will need to trust them. I figured out a simple way to implement them. It may be flawed but for now it seems to work.

I really need to start writing tests but am sticking to my initial commitment. I will start writing them prior to launch but after I am happy with the launch feature set. Having tests would give me a lot more confidence and help with building out things like streaks. Test driven development seems like it would make life a lot easier. ðŸ˜…

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Resolved bug that didn't creat daily entries at midnight in their timezone
- [x] Implemented rudimentary streaks!
- [x] Stopped running dev requests through Sqreen
- [x] User's word goal is no longer hardcoded (next up will being incremental daily goal!)

Challenges:

- I'll have to be careful changing GraphQL queries in prod
- With the golang Postgres driver, you have to cast datetime inputs (eg. `$2::timestamp`)
