# Day 12 - September 26, 2019

I don't have any excuses but I am sad to see how long it's been since I last worked on Wrabit. I knew it had been a while but seeing that my last entry was on September 17th didn't feel too good. I don't have any excuses and need to put in the work. Sometimes I doubt I can even build Wrabit. I know that I can but I have a lot of work to do.

I feel like I accomplished a fair amount tonight. I learned a lot about how the Stripe API integration will go. I got it functional (enough) on the front end. I just have some final calls to make on the backend when a user enters their credit card but, as per usual, the Stripe API is a pleasure to work with.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Read a lot of Stripe documentation to determine changes required for Stripe integration
- [x] Started adding actual documentation to make my life easier in the future
- [x] Completed the creation Stripe customers upon account creation
- [x] Added a credit card form to the plans page

Challenges:

- Doing the hard work. Lately I've been feeling overwhelmed by working alone.
