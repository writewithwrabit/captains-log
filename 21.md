# Day 21 - October 31, 2019

Happy Halloween! It's been a heck of a long time since I did anything on Wrabit. I've been _thinking about it_ a lot but I guess that doesn't help. One thing that is cool is I have been using it. It makes me feel **a lot** better. Hopefully other people will feel the same benefits I do when I use it.

I went to [React Conf 2019](https://blog.anthonymorris.dev/19-takeaways-from-react-conf-2019) for the first time. It was in Las Vegas. Didn't see much of Vegas but boy was it a good coonference. I learned a lot about Suspense and Concurrent mode. I can't wait to dig into some of the learnings. I'll be able to implement a lot of the ideas but have a decent amount of refactoring coming up!

Today I had limited working time so I just did a few things that I knew I could complete.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Add a `goal_hit` field to the `entries` table in the database
- [x] Visually show entries where user's have hit their writing goal on the Entries page
- [x] Fixed a date bug on the Entries page
- [x] Made the body unscrollable when viewing an old entry

Challenges:

- None!
