# Day 26 - November 15, 2019

So I can see the end of the tunnel in sight. However, my momentum has slowed a little bit. This tends to happen. Life tends to happen. I am continuing to work on my process and my discipline.

Despite the progress slowing down, I made good progress today! I started to build out the settings page which is the last page I need to populate before launch. I want to enable people to cancel their subscriptions. That's the smallest amount of functionality I need there. Eventually they will be able to do password resets, change their credit card, etc. Side note: the Stripe API is still wonderful to use.

I am really sad that my code still has no tests. The go code is also pretty heinous right now. My girlfriend is out of town next week so I am curious what I can accomplish but I also have a lot going on (React Vancouver talk)! Let's see if I can launch before December.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Built out more of the settings frontend
- [x] Hooked the backend up to Stripe to get subscription information
- [x] Display user account information on the frontend

Challenges:

- The go code is starting to become disgusting
