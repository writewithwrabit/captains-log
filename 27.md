# Day 27 - November 16, 2019

This morning I started coding at 6 am. That hasn't happened in a while but it felt good. I had a bug in my generated GraphQL code on the backend that I had too resolve.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Fixed backend GraphQL resolver for user subscriptions
- [x] Displayed subscription information on the frontend

Challenges:

- GqlGen gave me some funky problems
