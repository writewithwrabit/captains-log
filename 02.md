# Day 2 - July 19, 2019

I got a lot more done on day two. I'm fully engaged and have trouble falling asleep at night because I'd rather build Wrabit. It feels good to be working on a product that I'm passionate about.

I was feeling guilty for using a lot of developer tools to get up and running faster. Part of why I am building Wrabit is so I can become a stronger software developer. However, the product is a lot more important than building everything mimicking a pipeline similar to what Netflix has (and it's simply not required). As users begin to use the platform there will be plenty of time to work on the infrastructure and to optimize code.

The comits are already looking sloppy on the backend but I'm having fun. I like the idea of having the development of this project in the open. Sure, it's not flawless, but I'm doing the best I can with the skills I have now. I'm learning and having a boatload of fun along the way!

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Implemented auth using [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/).
  - Excellent idea all around. I'm going to be leaning heavily on [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) and it starts with auth.
- [x] Deployed the frontend with now. It was a delight.
  - I also decided to switch my personal website from [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to now. No hard feelings, just felt good using the same platform for both.
- [x] Started working on sprucing up the editor and fleshing out UI ideas. Using [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a great choice for now.
- [x] Setup a skeleton for the backend using [gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen).
- [x] Manually deployed the GraphQL server to GCP using [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/).
- [x] Setup [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com) on the frontend and backend. Currently not doing much but will help in the future. It does push backend code out to App Engine when PRs get merged into the master branch.

Challenges:

- Even with the help of Firebase, the app is a little slow to detect existing sessions. I need to improve this but I'll focus on that a little later.
- Working with gqlgen was pretty difficult at first. I've never used GraphQL and am _just_ starting to learn golang. It was rewarding to get it going with some basic functionality.
- Getting Tavis CI and App Engine to play nice with secrets took me longer than it should have. I tried a couple of different things, but ended up going with Travis encrypting a `.env` file and then extracting that in the pipeline. It works fine for now; I'd like to move the secrets to GCP sometime in the future.
