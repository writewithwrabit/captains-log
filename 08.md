# Day 8 - July 31, 2019

Short day but a good one. I continue to feel frustrated by my lack of time to commit to Wrabit. I've considered giving up other aspects (going to the gym) but know I should probably take care of myself so I don't burn on. Time does seem important on this project though.

Again, though it was short, I implemented something important. Entries for users actually save to the database. I have a simple and naive auto-save functionality. I want to utilize local storage incase a user loses internet. I'm also missing some UI feedback in regards to the auto-save. For now, it feels like progress and I guess that's good enough.

In the editor you work on **entries** but I still am adverse to calling Wrabit a _journal_. It's a journal, it's a scratchpad, it's whatever you want it to be.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Implemented a GraphQL mutation on the backend for `UpdateEntry` (allows updating the database with an entry)
- [x] Properly load and parse the latest entry on the frontend
- [x] Automatically save as a user edits their entry (using the new GraphQL mutation)
  - Currently throttled at ten seconds which is likely higher than I want

Challenges:

- Working on my code is already starting to bug me
  - I am trying to move fast with the goal of refactoring later but I am going to have my first refactor session soon
  - Refactoring is important and I want my code to be easy to understand and welcoming
