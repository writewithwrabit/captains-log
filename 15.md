# Day 15 - October 3, 2019

Got back to work on the landing page today. I'm making a lot of progress there and am almost done. I fixed a lot of shortcuts I took last time. It's not very responsive right now but it won't take me too much effort to make it _good enough_ for launch. I'll give myself a few more hours to put some finishing touches on the landing page and then I'll move on.

I haven't put any thought into content which will be the last step to the landing page. I'll probably change whatever I write a million times before I am happy with it. Something is better than nothing. Progress over perfection.

Considering I have only put 15 days into this thing I am pretty happy. I have a long way to go but launching it and getting user feedback will be exciting. Hopefully I get some folks using it!

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Completed the header section of the landing page
- [x] Completed the middle section of the landing page (the bulk of the content will go here)
- [x] Completed the footer section of the landing page
- [x] Fixed all the weird uses of percentages from when I started building the landing page

Challenges:

- None today! Things are going smoothly.
