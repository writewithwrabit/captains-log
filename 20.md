# Day 20 - October 17, 2019

Twenty! That seems like a milestone. In reality, that isn't a very high number of days. I'm happy with how far I've come. I can see the MVP release in the near future. It's funny because the more I get done, the more I feel like I have a lot to do. Don't get me wrong, _there is a lot to do_. I'm still happy with the direction I am headed. I'm missing _a lot_ of things. I have no tests, the code is a mess, but you can journal with Wrabit.

Do tests matter if I am not benefiting anyone? Not really. I said I would write tests before I launch. Maybe I'll save them as the first thing I do _after_ launch. Does that make me a terrible software engineer?

Today was a pretty good day. I am starting to develop the settings page. I want user's to be able to manage, or at least cancel, their membership easily. On top of that, they will be able to tweak their editors and silence any communications from us. I also started putting some life to the website. I like the direction I am taking with the design and am excited to see it evolve over the coming months.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Added a menu for settings/logout
- [x] Added some dummy pages for Settings and Stats so I don't get 404s anymore
- [x] Decided to go with [styled](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled) for my components so I can rid myself of CSS files
- [x] Created a `PageHeader` component to all pages can look/feel the same

Challenges:

- None!
