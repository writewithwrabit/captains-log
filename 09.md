# Day 9 - August 5, 2019

Last time I worked on Wrabit I got the editor to create or load the latest entry for the user. Thanks to Sentry I also noticed some janky auth stuff happening. Auth has always been a bit tricky for me to handle. Today I've refactored some of my auth/permission checking on the frontend and it's working a lot better now. It's something I wanted to put off fixing. After dealing with some of the issues during development today, I realized I had to deal with it now. It should be good for the foreseeable future!

I built a new GraphQL query to get `entriesByUserID`. This has allowed me to start building the entries page. I'm designing as I go, which is probably not ideal, but I did make sure to do wireframe sketches in my notebeook before putting any code down. I know that the page designs I launch with will likely change within the first few months but that's okay.

I'd like to go through the code and create issues on GitHub so I can keep track of the things I want to do. This will allow me to prioritize better than I am doing currently. It's all in my head! There is a lot to do to make the developer experince better which will allow others to easily contribute. I'm not in a rush there but other things are increasingly more important, tests for example.

I'm grateful for the Canadian holiday today so I can focus on Wrabit all day!

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Resolved issues related to not having the user information on page load
- [x] Added the ability to get all entries for a user
- [x] Added the ability to get all entries within a date range
- [x] Started building out the entries page for the user
- [x] Added a [calendar picker](http://react-day-picker.js.org/) for filtering entries
  - Went through a few iterations but this one is simple, clean, and the bundle size isn't bloated!

Challenges:

- No tests in the code makes me sad
  - I need to make sure I implement these sooner than later
- I haven't beeen dilligent enough with planning out tasks and keeping track of my todos
