# Day 25 - November 11, 2019

Security is definitely important. Not only in general (use a password manager, etc.) but for the users of Wrabit. I wanted to have their content encrypted to make it harder for me to read content and to make it near impossible for others to do so. Say the database leaked... well all the entries are encrypted so good luck reading them.

Today I implemented my first pass at encrypting/decrypting the content. It's good enough until post-launch I'd say. However, I'm going to use GCP KMS and implement rotating keys shortly after I get the platform running.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Implemented encrypted entry contents

Challenges:

- Deciding on an encryption method
