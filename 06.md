# Day 6 - July 24, 2019

I noticed I was running out of GCP credits already even though I was expecting not to be using any resources that would cost me. It turns out the database instance running all the time was indeed costing me.

Sometimes you walk away from a project and you swear it is in a working state. Then you come back and all of a sudden it's not working. You ask yourself, how could this ever have worked? This has happened twice to me over the past two days. I'm definitely a [1x engineer](https://1x.engineer/).

Although I have had some struggles with my backend, GraphQL is actually really impressive. Using the playground is an amazing experience once it's all hooked up. It hasn't even been that hard. Most of the problems have been minor issues caused by my lack of knowledge of go-isms. Most problems were solved just from the go compiler! Quickly solving problems with tech you don't know, without reading docs, is a good sign that the tool is intuitive.

I want to start working on the landup page and blocking the ability to login from production. This way I can just show people the website instead of using Ship. I'll still be able to collect some emails while providing better information.

I got some good feedback on the editor and have started to work on placement of the progress "meter". I want to show people how they are doing but not in a way that adds stress, distracts, or is downright ugly.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Applied for GCP credits from a few places.
- [x] Signed up for a [Crisp](https://crisp.chat/) account.
  - I definitely wanted something like this and originally was looking at [Intercom](https://intercom.com) but it's not cost effective.
- [x] Fixed issues with my User GraphQL schema.
- [x] Added CORS to GraphQL server.
- [x] Sign Up functionality works with Cloud SQL.
- [x] Added minimalistic progress bar at the bottom of the editor instead of a countdown.
- [x] Moved the positive word counter and made it more subtle.

Challenges:

- Using GCP in a cost effective way. I can't be all willy nilly with my resources.
- GraphQL on the backend is being difficult.
  - Somehow it _was_ working using the Firbase ID as an ID in the database but after I added new GraphQL methods to create/get a user that stopped working.
  - I added a new serial `id` column and a `firebase_id` column and all is good.
