# Day 32 - December 2, 2019

While I haven't collaborated with anyone on Wrabit _yet_, I do have someone who wants to help out. This will be great going forward because developing alone isn't nearly as fun as working with others. Producsts aren't nearly as good when built in silos either.

Today I did some project management but also [took some steps to make collaboration a bit easier](https://github.com/writewithwrabit/server/issues/45). I took the next few day off of work so I can launch as soon as possible! ðŸŽ‰

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Built out some project management stuff on GitHub to track what needs to be done prior to release
- [x] Started Dockerizing the backend

Challenges:

- Launch is coming; I'm terrified and excited
