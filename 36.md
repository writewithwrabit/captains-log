# Day 36 - December 6, 2019

I've gotten some small feedback on the new landing page and folks seem to like it. More importantly I got feedback on how to improve performance and reduce jank. I've gone ahead and done some cleanup there. The landing page is now in the "good enough" stage. Good enough _for now_. Good enough _for launch_. I'm actually happy with it. This is how Wrabit was supposed to be in my head.

Today I have a couple of bugs I want to look into and fix but otherwise I'll be focusing on devops. Straightening out environments so things are ready to go on Monday!

[UPDATE]

I've got prod deployed and I created the first production account. I have to admit, I am pretty proud. I can't wait to see where Wrabit goes. The 36 days of development have been a complete joy for me. I have been lucky to be able to build with passion. This is the first step for me but it is one I am extremely proud of. After launch day I won't update the Captain's Log anymore as there will (hopefully) be other contributors.

If you're reading this thanks for following along during one the proudest moments of my life.
