# Day 1 - July 18, 2019

Here are some of the things I accomplished:

- [x] Decided on [Zeit's](https://zeit.co) [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) framework and the [now](https://zeit.co/now) pipeline
  - Excellent decision; the developer experience is buttery
- [x] Initialized the project and dumped in the [raw editor](https://www.slatejs.org/) to give it a spin

Challenges:

This was the easiest day by far. Nothing but smooth sailing.
