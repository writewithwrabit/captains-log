# Day 23 - November 3, 2019

Yesterday I was able to get a basic UI done for the stats page so my goal for today was to populate it with real stats. Having the stats page finshed would've been enough for me to be happy but I accomplished a heck of a lot more than that!

[I learned a lot when I went to React Conf](https://blog.anthonymorris.dev/19-takeaways-from-react-conf-2019) a few weeks ago. One of the things that excited me the most was the discovery of Relay and how Facebook uses it. Since I was having problems with my Apollo setup and I was excited by Relay's promise, I decided today I would take a stab at ripping out Apollo. It actually wasn't the challenging and I closed four bug tickets in the process!

Today feels like my most successful day in a while. Closed four bugs, implemented the stats queries and plugged them in into the frontned, _and_ implement Relay. Phew! I feel like I can actually see the launch on the horizon.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Fixed a UI bug on the entries page
- [x] Implemented stats query on the backend
- [x] Added stats GraphQL query to the frontend
- [x] Replaced Apollo client with Relay
- [x] Fixed issue with server side renderng (by removing Apollo)
- [x] Fixed React Hook bug that was happening with the settings popup window
- [x] Fixed issue with the stats page and loading data
- [x] Fixed a bug where new users wouldn't get redirected to the editor

Challenges:

- Learning Relay
  - This was mostly averted as I went with the easiest Relay solution possible
- Had some weird npm registry issues during deployment
