# Day 11 - September 17, 2019

Today I went down a rabbit hole. I probably spent a little too much time fiddling with the design of a small page. It's definitely good enough where it is, but I seem to worry about a lot of the small stuff. Being pixel perfect won't matter to many people at launch. It matters to me though. I want to be proud of the work I'm doing. I want it to look, feel, and perform good.

I'm finding that I am starting to think of copy and that's going to be a hard battle to fight.

Today was slow but every bit of effort counts.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Browsed lots of design inspiration
- [x] Created a subscription page

Challenges:

- Nobody to keep me accountable and focused so I can get caught going down rabbit holes that I enjoy but might not be the most productive.
