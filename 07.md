# Day 7 - July 28, 2019

It's been a few days since I had some time to put in real work on Wrabit. Unfortunately tonight I only put in an hour and a half too. On the flip side, I finished one of my university classes three weeks early which should allow me to focus on Wrabit a bit more.

A few cool things happened on the design front in the last couple of days. I got a logo and a brand guide made up. While these aren't strictly needed, I felt like spending a few hundred dollars on myself (Wrabit) to help tie everything together. I'll be getting a few other mocks made up to help offload some thinking.

Another great thing was getting a lot more credits for Google Cloud Platform. I've got ~$1500 of runway to get Wrabit off the ground. Let's see how it goes!

Tonight was mostly backend stuff. I did a little cleanup, added and enhanced some GraphQL queries, and hooked up Apollo client on the frontend. I am querying the backend from the frontend now! It seems like such a trivial task but felt good to accomplish. Since this is my first time using GraphQL I have a lot to learn. I'm trying to move fast; I will have _a lot_ of refactoring to do in my future.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Got the ability to get the latest entry for a user done
- [x] If a user hasn't started an entry for a particular day, one will be created
  - No need to schedule the creation because we don't need entries for days they don't log on
- [x] GraphQL queries on the frontend!
- [x] Very minor database changes (added `created_at` and `updated_at` columns to current tables)

Challenges:

- GraphQL is _awesome_ but I know nothing about it; learning as I go is fun but can slow me down at times
- I am very bad at golang
  - I love when it fails to compile
