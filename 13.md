# Day 13 - September 29, 2019

I love using Stripe. Their dashboard is easy to use and understand but it's their develop tooling that truly shines. Working with their go library has been an absolute breeze, it just works.

Today is a pretty big day for me as I finished the MVP of the signup flow (frontend and backend). It's important that I'm able to explain the business model to user's upfront. There is a 30 day trial but folks will have to enter their credit cards. Not having a free version of the product is a risk I'm willing to take. Since I am not trying to get rich off of this, and a lot of the money will be donated to research (I haven't mentioned this yet, have I?), I think it will be okay.

Things are coming together but the more I do, the more I think of tiny micro adjustments that I want to make to the UI/UX. I am doing my best to file these away for later. It's more important for me to launch a functional MVP so I can get people on the platform, get feedback, and continue building. I need to make sure I create tickets on GitHub or Notion so I can keep track of everything!

Also, my girlfriend signed up for Wrabit today! She has already given good feedback and seems to be enjoying the (limited) experience so far.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Finished the signup flow on the backend (Stripe customers, credit card, and subscriptions get created)
- [x] Finished Stripe credit card validation on the frontend
- [x] Finished the first pass of the signup flow on the frontend
- [x] Added the ability to get a user by ID or Firebase ID
- [x] Fixed issue with restricted endpoints
- [x] Minor refactoring
- [x] Cleaned up test/dead users in the database
- [x] Fixed "production" bug based on all API endpoints needing a token

Challenges:

- Mostly stuck on golang issues; getting a datetime from the SQL database has created difficulties
- I am failing at data structures in Go and I think it should be easier than it seems to be
  - I need to read more instead of trying to brute force my way through...
- I still have no tests which is dangerouns
  - I cannot launch without tests due to high risk (see: bug created today)
