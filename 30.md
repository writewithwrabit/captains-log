# Day 30 - November 30, 2019

Today I decided to tackle the ability to send emails to users. I created a mailgun account and did some refactoring to make it easier to send a welcome email. I absolutely dread making email templates. I haven't created the template I will use (yet) but will probably have that done by the end of the weekend.

The emails don't send properly right now because of a email domain configuraton issue. I'm still happy that I got the accounts setup and updated the backend to handle emails. I also fixed a few minor bugs. Looking forward to a productive day with Wrabit tomorrow.

Thirty days into Wrabt!

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Setup a mailgun account so I can send emails to users
- [x] Setup an email account to handle emails on the `writewithwrabit.com` domain
- [x] Fixed a minor frontend bug with a misconfigued component
- [x] Added mailgun to the backend
- [x] Updated TravisCI to build the backend with `go 1.13` (build is green again!)
- [x] Updated App Engine to run `go 1.13` as well
- [x] Updated a bunch of dependencies on the frontend

Challenges:

- Mailgun / SMTP / Email issues
- Wrestled with some build issues after I realzed I wasn't on `go 1.13`
