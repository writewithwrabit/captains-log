# Day 34 - December 4, 2019

Working on Wrabit so much definitely makes me _feel_ happy. I'm excited by what will come. I'm excited by all of the things Wrabit _can't_ do... yet. This whole experience has been amazing for me and I don't know how to express how good building a product I love feels.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Added the ability for a user to update their writing goal
- [x] Fixes a bunch of bugs I introduced yesterday ðŸ˜…
- [x] Created a better global suspense boundary
- [x] Replaced the Next.js error page with a custom one
- [x] Fixed bugs with the editor (it now saves faster, more reliably, and [when you format stuff](https://github.com/writewithwrabit/webapp/issues/13))

Challenges:

- Every time I fix something I find something new to fix!
