# Day 31 - December 1, 2019

Making email templates drives me wild. I'm extremely grateful I found [Beefee](https://beefree.io/) because I was able to make a template that is good enough for quite a while. I'll definitely use it in the future. I'm not usually a fan of drag and drop editors but email template development is like frontend development in 1995. I'm spoiled by today's tooling and so I have trouble doing it. The template I made is by no means flashy or fancy but it's just for email communication within the app. I'll make more over time.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Resolved MX issues so email can be sent from mailgun
- [x] Developed MVP of email application template
- [x] Finished content for the welcome email
- [x] Adjusted the login and signup pages to match brand better
- [x] Added an app loading screen that is better than `LOADING...`
- [x] [Fixed a bug where the stats page errored for new users](https://github.com/writewithwrabit/server/issues/25)
- [x] Enhanced the empty state messages for personal stats
- [x] Added an empty state for the `EntriesList` component

Challenges:

- I got lucky with another day with little difficulty
