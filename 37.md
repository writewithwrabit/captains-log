# Day 37 - December 7, 2019

Alright, the production version of Wrabit is running. Two paying users have subscribed! Just kidding, it's myself and my girlfriend. That still count right?

Today I fixed a bug with the dynamic word goal logic. That was the last important thing to fix prior to launch. I think everything else from here on out are nice to haves but will make me more proud!

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Fixed dynamic word goal logic
- [x] Implemented form validation on the signup form
- [x] Minor visual and mobile enhancements

Challenges:

- None really!
