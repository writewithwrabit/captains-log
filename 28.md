# Day 28 - November 24, 2019

Alright, it seems like forever (again) since I got some coding in on Wrabit. I think working alone makes things harder. Sometimes I don't feel motivated. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed. Scared even. What happens if no one cares about the platform? What happens if I can't even finish the damn thing? Well... I'll survive.

Last week was a big week for me personally. I gave a talk at the local [React meetup](https://reactvancouver.com/). This is something I'm really proud of. I even gave Wrabit a bit of a shoutout. It was a lot of fun and the talk spawned out of work I did on Wrabit. I want to give more talks in the future. I want to keep growing and pushing my React knowledge. I want Wrabit to be a _great_ user experience.

All that being said, today I accomplished something that was pretty important. Users can cancel (and resubscribe) their own subcriptions! This is something I want to do before launch. If they don't like the product, I wanted it to be easy for them to cancel. I don't want people to feel trapped. I want Wrabit to be something people _opt in_ on. I want them to see the benefit; to _feel_ the benefit.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Implement cancel/resubscribe on the frontend
- [x] Implemented cancel/resubscribe on the backend
- [x] Re-implemented the entry calendar picker (it was wasn't doing anything after I implemented relay)
- [x] [Fixed a bug where the calendar picker wasn't uisng local timezones](https://github.com/writewithwrabit/webapp/issues/36)
- [x] Cleaned up some test entries that were increasing stats (and filling up my dashboard!)
- [x] Implemented confetti that explodes across the screen when a user hits their word goal

Challenges:

- None today, the seas ⛵️ were calm!
