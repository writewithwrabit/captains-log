# Day 16 - October 7, 2019

I went to Whistler this past weekend. It was the first time I have been without my computer in a long time. Surprisingly I actually feel productive from a Wrabit perspectve. I may have only been doing brainstorming and ideation, I think it was needed.

Today I completed the first iteration of the landing page. Writing content was a lot harder than I expected it to be. I haven't found the voice I want for Wrabit and it was incredibly frustrating. I will have to continue to tweak the content here and there until I am happy. Instead of letting this paralyze me, I have settled for good enough.

The landing page isn't responsive. People can actually sign up (instead of being taken to a "Coming Soon" funnel). None of the footer pages are real (About, Contact Us, etc). Either way, this is progress.

I am going to go back to feature development and will finish the rest of the pages later.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Wrote some content for the landing page
- [x] Deployed the first version of the landing page

Challenges:

- Writing content is hard
  - I haven't found the voice of Wrabit but I will leave it for now..
