# Day 18 - October 9, 2019

Tomorrow is [Word Mental Health Day](https://www.who.int/mental_health/world-mental-health-day). Knowing this, I decided I would share my landing page. It's not much but it's a new post about Wrabit. I haven't shared anything since I created my Product Hunt page. Perhaps this will get a bit more visibility and signups for the beta. I wanted to get some Google Analytics hooked up so I can at least see if people are looking at the website.

While doing this, I've noticed there is a lot to be improved with regards to my production build on the website. I'll create GitHub issues in the near future so I can keep track and work on them as I have time. No need for premature optimization, no one even knows Wrabit exists yet!

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Added Google Analytics

Challenges:

- I'm learning about issues/misconfigurations with Next JS :)
