# Day 35 - December 5, 2019

Last night I onboarded Ryan to Wrabit! While the app isn't in the best state for outside contributors, I think it's good enough for Ryan to come on board. Having someone to collaborate with will help Wrabit get better faster. Not just because more work can get done but also because product development is better with collaboration.

Today I rewrote the entire landing page. The old one _wasn't Wrabit_ in my opinion. It _felt_ wrong. Not very concrete definitions but boy am I glad I redid it. Originally I was going to hold off and do it post-launch. Doing it today allows me to launch something I am actually proud of. Mere days before the MVP announcement and it finally feels write to me.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Redesigned and built the new landing page
- [x] Rebuilt the app header to match the new landing page
- [x] Cleaned up some junk code
- [x] Created a new Open Graph image and made sure it displays on various platforms (Twitter, FB, etc)

Challenges:

- Always discovering new bugs
