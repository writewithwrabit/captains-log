# Day 38 - December 8, 2019

The last day before launch! I'm just doing some minor things today. I added a Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I'm also going to add validation to the login page. These are the small things I have left prior to launch. Just some things to help the users. I don't want to commit to any big changes.

After this my main focus will be testing! How fast do you think I can get to 90% code coverage? Hopefully quickly because I want to get to new features right away!

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Added a Privacy Policy
- [x] Added a Terms of Service
- [x] Added form validation to the login page
- [x] Made "Forgot your password?" work
- [x] Added more CTAs to the landing page
- [x] Fixed some minor width issues for smaller screens on the landing page
- [x] Simplified positioning of the sample devices on the landing page
- [x] Made minor adjustments to the word goal algorithm (agan...)

Challenges:

- No challenges as I'm playing it safe; don't want to break anything before tomorrow!
