# Day 5 - July 23, 2019

Today will likely be a short day. I've got to do some schoolwork but wanted to get some tasks done anyways. A little bit every day counts.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Submitted design proposals! Having some design assets going forward will help me prepare for launch. I've had a few people ask for more details about the app so I think I might prioritize the landing/home page.
- [x] Implemented [Sentry](https://sentry.io) for error handling on the frontend.
- [x] Hooked up form fields that weren't working before.
- [x] Got Apollo GraphQL working on the frontend.
- [x] Created resources on the backend for creating a user.

Challenges:

- Being a responsible adult.
- Working with the GraphQL backend and golang is always a challenge.
- Oddly enough I had to enable the GCP Cloud SQL Admin API. It wasn't enabled but I was connecting to the DB before... ðŸ¤”
