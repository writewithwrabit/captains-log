# Day 03 - July 21, 2019

Today I've mostly been fiddling around with the editor. I'll do my best to split my free time between school and Wrabit (even though I want to give it all to Wrabit).

I met with a couple of friends who will help me do early user experience tests. It'll be extremely valuable to get feedback even before launch. I'm going to try and convince them to help me with some other tasks too (like marketing). In fact, [Chris]((http://www.thefreshburst.com/)) was the one who suggested I log all of my work to learn from the process.

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Enhanced editor functionality
  - [x] Bold, italic, and underline now works.
  - [x] Three different headings now work (H1, H2, H3). I think that's going to be good enough for most use cases.
  - [x] Bulleted and numbered lists work.
- [x] Minor styling applied to the header so its ugliness doesn't distract me.

Challenges:

- The editor isn't as straightforward as you'd think. I decided to use [Slate](https://www.slatejs.org/) because it is very powerful and customizable. The editor is going to be so important with Wrabit that I want full control. Plus, it's really no slowing me down too much.
  - I specifically had trouble getting the headings to work in a dropdown instead of buttons. It's the right decision, in my opinion, and I learned a lot more about Slate. I should be able to work with it easier going forward.
