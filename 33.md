# Day 33 - December 3, 2019

I finished dockerizing the server. It's not a perfect developer experience (far from it) but this is a step in the right direction. I'm going to be onboarding a friend this week so the test will be to let them try and get the stack up without my help. I'll ask for them to write down difficulties so we can improve the process and documentation. As an open source project that will be very important going forward. We may not get _a lot_ of contributors but we want it to be a good developer experience for those who choose to contribute. Plus... it makes my life easier! ðŸ˜…

Things I accomplished:

- [x] Finished dockerizing the backend
- [x] Added a counter for user's to switch between counting down from their goal or counting up to it
- [x] Added a dynamic word goal on the backend (takes a user's streak and time since they last wrong into account)
- [x] Hooked new word goaal GraphQL query to up to the frontend

Challenges:

- Launch is coming; I'm terrified and excited
- I need a good way to test streaks locally
